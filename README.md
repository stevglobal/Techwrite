 File Structure
### 1. Title
**Title**: Project Name
*Subheader if needed*: Brief description

**Syntax**: Use `#` for headers. The number of `#` characters denotes the level of the header.

### 2. Table of Contents
```markdown
## Table of Contents
- [Overview](#overview)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Getting Started](#getting-started)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- [License](#license)
```
**Syntax**: Use `-` for bullet points and `[text](#anchor)` for links to sections.

### 3. Overview
**Overview**: Introduce the project, its purpose, and any important information someone should know about it.

**Syntax**: Plain text is sufficient, but you can use Markdown for formatting like **bold** and _italic_.

### 4. Installation
**Installation**: Provide clear instructions on how to install the project. Include any dependencies or prerequisites.

**Syntax**: Use code blocks for commands, like this:
```bash
$ npm install project-name
```

### 5. Getting Started
**Getting Started**: Explain how to get the project up and running after installation.

**Syntax**: Use numbered lists for steps, like:
```markdown
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to project directory.
3. Start the server.
```

### 6. Usage
**Usage**: Describe how to use the project. Include examples if possible.

**Syntax**: Code examples can be included in a fenced code block:
```javascript

const myModule = require('project-name');
myModule.doSomething();
```

### 7. Contributing

```

## 3. Additional Tips
- **Headers**: Use `#` for H1, `##` for H2, and so on.
- **Code Highlighting**: Use ````language` syntax for code highlighting, where `language` is the programming language.
- **Links**: Use `[text](URL)` for hyperlinks.
- **Lists**: Use `-` for bullet lists and `1.` for numbered lists.
- **Emphasis**: Use `_single underscores_` for italics and `**double asterisks**` for bold.
